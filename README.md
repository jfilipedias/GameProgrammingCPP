# Game Progamming In C++

This repository contains the code examples and exercises from the book "Game Programming in C++". The book covers various topics related to game development, including graphics, physics, and AI. The book build the project using the library SDL2, but, with porpuse of challenge myself, I decided to use the library SDL3.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code examples, clone the repository and open the solution in Visual Studio 2022.

In order to build the projects you must follow the steps bellow:
- Make sure you have the SDL ([v3.2.16](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-3.2.16)) "Source code" extracted on `C:\Libraries` and configured as in the [SDL with Visual Studio introduction guide](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/docs/INTRO-visualstudio.md).
- Make sure you have the SDL_Image ([v3.2.4](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image/releases/tag/release-3.2.4)) "Source code" extracted on `C:\Libraries` path and configured as in the [SDL_Image with Visual Studio introduction guide](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image/blob/main/docs/INTRO-visualstudio.md).
